# Job Queueing and Submission

## Introduction

ALCF's Graphcore POD64 system uses PBS for job submission and queueing. Below are some of the important commands for using PBS. For more information see the Userâ€™s Guide (UG) section of the [BS Big Book](https://2021.help.altair.com/2021.1/PBSProfessional/PBS2021.1.pdf)


>**NOTE: Jobs that require IPUs will fail unless launched with `qsub`.**
>**NOTE: There is a single PBS scheduler for the Graphcore POD64.**

## qsub in interactive mode

The PBS command `qsub` can be used to start an interactive session allocated a specified number of IPUs. The interactive session will not inherit tle launching environment. Normal interactive shell startup will occur, e.g. .bashrc will be run for bash users.

Example:

```console
qsub -q workq -lwalltime=01:00:00 -lselect=1:ncpus=1+1:nipus=1 -IV
```

## qsub in batch mode

Alternatively, the PBS command `qsub` can be used to run scripts in batch mode, allocated a specified number of IPUs. Non-interactive shell startup will occur, e.g. .bashrc will be run for bash users, but in non-interactive mode, .bashrc typically exits before setting any user variables.

To do this, create a bash script (submit-mnist-poptorch-job.sh here as an example) with the commands that you want to execute.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

python mnist_poptorch.py
```

Then pass the bash script as an input to the `qsub` command as shown below, requesting the number of IPUs required:

```console
qsub -q workq -lwalltime=01:00:00 -lselect=1:ncpus=1+1:nipus=1 submit-mnist-poptorch-job.sh
```

## qstat

The `qstat` command provides information about jobs located in the (default) PBS scheduling queue.

```console
$ qstat -w
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
              2572       p64 Graphcor username  R       1:12      1 gc-poplar-02
```

## SInfo ??? TODO

TODO SInfo is used to view partition and node information for a system running Slurm.

```console
$ sinfo ? Is there any such thing for PBS? 
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
p64*         up   infinite      3   idle gc-poplar-[02-04]
```

## qdel

The qdel command deletes jobs in the order given.<br>
Get the job id using qstat -w

```bash
qdel job_id
```
